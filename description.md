In this project, basic machine learning concepts on data collected for housing prices in the Boston, Massachusetts area have been applied to predict the selling price of a new home. Data is first explored to obtain important features and descriptive statistics about the dataset. Next, properly splitting the data into testing and training subsets, and determining a suitable performance metric for this problem. Analyze performance graphs for a learning algorithm with varying parameters and training set sizes enabling us to pick the optimal model that best generalizes for unseen data. 

Project Highlights
This project is designed to get you acquainted to working with datasets in Python and applying basic machine learning techniques using NumPy and Scikit-Learn. Before being expected to use many of the available algorithms in the sklearn library, it will be helpful to first practice analyzing and interpreting the performance of your model.

Things you will learn by completing this project:

How to use NumPy to investigate the latent features of a dataset.
How to analyze various learning performance plots for variance and bias.
How to determine the best-guess model for predictions from unseen data.
How to evaluate a model's performance on unseen data using previous data.

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

Python
NumPy
pandas
scikit-learn
matplotlib
